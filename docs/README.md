# ursadb documentation

## User guide 

- [Index types](./indextypes.md): Picking index types you need is an important
    decision that's hard to change later.
- [Datasets](./datasets.md): Introduction to mquery's datasets.
- [Indexing in-depth](./indexing.md): Read if you need to index a considerable
    number of files.
- [Performance and limits](./limits.md): Read in case you're not sure if mquery
    can handle your collection.
- [On-disk format](./ondiskformat.md): Read if you want to understand ursadb's on
    disk format (hint: many files are just JSON and can be read/edited with vim).
