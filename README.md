UrsaDB
======

A 3gram search engine for querying Terabytes of data in milliseconds. Optimized for working with binary files (for example, malware dumps).

Created in [CERT.PL](https://cert.pl). Originally by Jarosław Jedynak ([tailcall.net](https://tailcall.net)), extended and improved by Michał Leszczyński.

**Please note that this repository is only for UrsaDB project (3gram database). In order to see instructions on how to set up the complete mquery system, see [CERT-Polska/mquery](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/mquery).**

Quick start
-----------

### Install UrsaDB
#### From pre-built package
UrsaDB is distributed in a form of pre-built Debian packages which are targeting Debian Buster and Ubuntu 18.04. You can get the packages from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/ursadb/releases).

You may use this convenience one-liner to install the latest UrsaDB package along with the required dependencies:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CERT-Polska/ursadb/master/install_deb.sh | sudo bash
```

#### From sources
1. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y gcc-7 g++-7 libzmq3-dev cmake build-essential clang-format
   ```
2. Build project:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-7 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-7 -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```
3. Install binaries to `/usr/local/bin`:
   ```
   sudo make install
   ```
4. (Optional) Consider registering UrsaDB as a systemd service:
   ```
   cp contrib/systemd/ursadb.service /etc/systemd/system/
   systemctl enable ursadb
   ```

### Database initialization
1. Create new database:
   ```
   mkdir /opt/ursadb
   ursadb_new /opt/ursadb/db.ursa
   ```
2. Run UrsaDB server:
   ```
   ursadb /opt/ursadb/db.ursa
   ```
3. Connect with UrsaCLI:
   ```
   $ ursacli
   [2020-04-13 18:16:36.511] [info] Connected to UrsaDB v1.3.0 (connection id: 006B8B4571)
   ursadb>
   ```
4. Index some files:
   ```
   ursadb> index "/opt/samples";
   ```
5. Now you can perform queries (e.g. match all files with three null bytes):
   ```
   ursadb> select {00 00 00};
   ```

Check out the "Queries" section in README to learn what kinds of commands can be issued to UrsaDB.


Queries
-------

### Indexing
#### Directly provided paths
A filesystem path could be indexed using `index` command:

```
index "/opt/something";
```

or multiple paths at once:

```
index "/opt/something" "/opt/foobar";
```

by default it will be indexed using `gram3` index. Index types may be specified manually:

```
index "/opt/something" with [gram3, text4, hash4, wide8];
```

#### Paths in a list file
For convenience it's also possible to make UrsaDB read a file containing a list of targets to be indexed,
each one separated by a newline.

```
index from list "/tmp/file-list.txt"
```

or

```
index from list "/tmp/file-list.txt" with [gram3, text4, hash4, wide8];
```

while exemplary contents of `/tmp/file-list.txt` is:

```
/opt/something
/opt/foobar
```

### Select
#### Strings ("primitives")
Select queries could use ordinary strings, hex strings and wide strings.

Query for ASCII bytes `abc`:
```
select "abc";
```

The same query with hex string notation:
```
select {616263};
```

Query for wide string `abc` (the same as `{610062006300}`):
```
select w"abc";
```

#### Logical operators
Elements could be AND-ed:
```
select "abc" & "bcd";
```

and OR-ed:
```
select "abc" | "bcd";
```

Queries may also use parenthesis:
```
select ("abc" | "bcd") & "cde";
```

#### Minimum operator
You may query for samples which contain at least N of M strings:
```
select min 2 of ("abcd", "bcdf", "cdef");
```

is equivalent to:

```
select ("abcd" & "bcdf") | ("abcd" & "cdef") | ("bcdf" & "cdef");
```

Note that `min N of (...)` is executed more efficiently than latter "combinatorial" example. Such syntax is directly corresponding to yara's "[sets of strings](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.4.0/writingrules.html#sets-of-strings)" feature.

This operator accepts arbitrary expressions as it's arguments, e.g.:
```
select min 2 of ("abcd" & "bcdf", "lorem" & "ipsum", "hello" & "hi there");
```
in this case inner expressions like `"abcd" & "bcdf"` will be evaluated first.

Minimum operator could be also nested in some expression, e.g.:
```
select "abcd" | ("cdef" & min 2 of ("hello", "hi there", "good morning"));
```

### Status
Query for the status of tasks running in the database:
```
status;
```

The output format is a JSON object with the details of all tasks. Exact format of these sub-objects is defined in [Responses.cpp](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/ursadb/blob/master/libursa/Responses.cpp).

### Topology
Check current database topology - what datasets are loaded and which index types they use.
```
topology;
```

Exemplary output:
```
> topology;
OK
DATASET aa266884
INDEX aa266884 gram3
INDEX aa266884 text4

DATASET bc43a921
INDEX bc43a921 gram3
INDEX bc43a921 text4
```

Means that there are two datasets (partitions), both backed with indexes of type `gram3` and `text4`.

### Reindex
Add new index type to the existing dataset. Before reindexing, you need to determine the ID of the dataset
which has to be indexed (may be done using `topology` command).

Example:
```
reindex "bc43a921" with [hash4];
```

will reindex already existing dataset `bc43a921` with `hash4` type index.

### Compact
Force database compacting.

In order to force compacting of all datasets into a single one:
```
compact all;
```

In order to force smart compact (database will decide which datasets do need compacting, if any):
```
compact smart;
```

Inner workings
--------------

### gram3 index

UrsaDB is using few slightly different methods of indexing files, having `gram3` indexes as a most basic concept.

When the database is about to create a `gram3` index for a given file, it extracts all possible three-byte combinations from it. An index is a big map of: `3gram` => `list of files which contain it`.

For instance, if we would index a text file containing ASCII string `TEST MALWARE` (ASCII: `54 45 53 54 20 4D 41 4C 57 41 52 45`), then the database would generate the following trigrams (`_` denotes space character):

| # | Substring | Trigram    |
| - | --------- | ---------- |
| 0 | `TES`     | `544553`   |
| 1 | `EST`     | `455354`   |
| 2 | `ST_`     | `535420`   |
| 3 | `T_M`     | `54204D`   |
| 4 | `_MA`     | `204D61`   |
| 5 | `MAL`     | `4D616C`   |
| 6 | `ALW`     | `414C57`   |
| 7 | `LWA`     | `4C5741`   |
| 8 | `WAR`     | `574152`   |
| 9 | `ARE`     | `415245`   |

![](docs/gram1.png)

An index maps a trigram to a list of files, so the new file will be added to the abovementioned lookups.

### gram3 queries
When querying for string `TEST MALWARE`, the database will query trigram index in order to determine which files do contain sequence `544553`, then which files contain `455354` and so on till `415245`. Such partial results will be ANDed and then the result set (list of probably matching files) is returned.

The drawing presents how trigrams are mapped to file contents.
![](docs/gram2.png)

Such searching technique sometimes may yield false positives, but it's never going to yield any true negatives. Thus, it may be appropriate for quick filtering (see [mquery project](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/mquery) - we use UrsaDB there in order to accelerate the process of malware searching).

### text4 index

String literals are very common in binaries. Thus, it's useful to have a specialized index for ASCII characters.

In `text4` index, ASCII characters are packed in a manner similar to [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) algorithm. Due to that, it is possible to generate a trigram out of four characters.

![](docs/4gram3.png)

Note that such an index doesn't respond to queries containing non-ASCII bytes, so it should be combined with at least `gram3` index.

### wide8

Because searching for `UTF-16` is also useful, there is a special index which works similarily to `text4`. In this case, ASCII characters interleaved with zeros are decoded.

![](docs/4gram5.png)

### hash4

Yet another type of index is `hash4`, which creates trigrams based on hashes of 4-byte sequences in the source file.
